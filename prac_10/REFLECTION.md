# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were averagely close to my actual time even though I took a couple minutes longer.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimates fluctuated but, they seemed t0 decline in accuracy to the point where my actual time for one
program was an 1 hour and 40 minutes over the estimate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt the I seem quite accurate with some of my estimates but, most of the time I do take a longer than I think.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learnt that feedback is important as others can catch something I cannot see and that
I learn to take criticism constructively.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learnt that reading other people's code can help me reinforce my knowledge but also can help me learn new things
I didn't know prior.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 5 Code review](https://github.com/taitymrobinson/cp1404practicals/pull/3#issuecomment-2454582612)

### Explanation

What I think was good is that I was thorough with my review and sounded as nice as I could with how I commented on the
code.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6 Code review](https://github.com/Kanos812/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-15387074331)

### Explanation

I tried to suggest possible changes in a nice way. I was also quite thorough with my explanations and/or queries.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I believe these practical tasks should contain more revision and/or questions as, in CP1401, at the start of each prac
students had to answer a small set of questions related to that week's content. I think this would be beneficial as it
would allow students to think about what they learnt, properly storing it in their long-term memory.

I also believe a couple revision questions for a previous week's content should be implemented, even if it was just
1 - 3 questions. This would allow students to revise and remember the previous week's content more effectively.

Finally, I think it would be very cool if in one of the practicals, even if it was something extra, for students 
to make a small yet useful script that would automate something for them. It would be nice to get a feel of Python
in a different context.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

For most of my practicals, my code's structure seemed good as well as my code's efficiency. 
Also, I did mostly well at getting my practicals in on time. Except for the last few.
