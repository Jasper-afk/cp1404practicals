# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

85%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have tried to schedule watching the videos the day prior to the class.
I watch the videos on my personal computer at home and do it in blocks, giving
myself a break when I feel I need one.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My engagement with the classes are going well, I am talking more in class sometimes than I used to
and will try to talk more.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I seem to leave my lecture video watching until late in the afternoon which does not give me enough time
to take it slow to understand everything.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

The only thing I am doing is using less efficient expressions or statements sometimes. I want to try and start
rechecking some of my code to see if there is a better option.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

My code seems quite good in terms of  structure and syntax, except for the occasional hiccup where I use a 
less efficient option to complete a task.
